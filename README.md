# OpenSumi Documentation Website

✨ Powered by [OpenSumi Gatsby Theme](https://github.com/opensumi/gatsby-theme).

[![CI](https://github.com/opensumi/docs/actions/workflows/documentation.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/opensumi/docs/actions/workflows/documentation.yml)

This website is built using [gatsbyjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

```console
yarn
```

## Local Development

```console
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```console
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Deployment

```console
yarn deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.

This case teaches you how to develop your own modules from scratch, step by step, by implementing a TodoList list in OpenSumi, and through this case you will gain some knowledge:

- How to create a module.
- How to present a list.
- How to use and register services by DI.
- How to use the contribution point mechanism.
- How to implement frontend and backend communication.

We aim to：

- Register a TodoList panel in the left explorer panel.
- Display TodoList list.
- Suppport quick addition of Todo items by using shortcut keys.
- Implement basic two-way communication logic between front and back end.

By studying this case, you will be able to quickly get started with OpenSumi's module development. 

At the same time, if you want to see the code directly, you can directly access the repo [opensumi/todo-list-sample](https://github.com/opensumi/todo-list-sample), and run projects to get some understandings.
